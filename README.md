# RiscVCache
This project implements a memory hierarchy in C++ with a focus on designing a memory controller. The memory hierarchy consists of L1 and L2 caches, main memory, and a victim cache. The L1 cache is direct-mapped, the L2 cache is 8-way set-associative, and a victim cache is fully-associative. The code, written exclusively in C++, follows a modular approach with well-defined functions, adhering to an exclusive/write-no-allocate/write-through cache design. The system processes load (LW) and store (SW) instructions from a trace file, providing miss rates for L1 and L2, along with the average access time (AAT). The code is compiled using "g++ *.cpp -o memory_driver" and results are formatted as "(L1,L2,AAT)" in the terminal.
